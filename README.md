Our baseline non-persistent harness “testfuzzer.cpp” (with 15 API calls included)

Our completed harness “persistentharness.cpp”

The existing harness from OSS-Fuzz changed to work with AFL++ "their_harness.cpp"

Coverage reports generated using LCOV on persistentharness (coverage_our) and their_harness (coverage_their)
